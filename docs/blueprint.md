# **App Name**: RockCO2

## Core Features:

- Role-Based Dashboards: Implement a dashboard with quick access buttons for each user type (Supply Coordinator, Field Surveyor, Application Operator, Soil Technician, Lab Technician, Carbon Analyst, Admin). While the user personas can be plenty, they all need to be able to see all the sections on the app as their roles are mixed...sometimes a single person is filling up all these forms so they all should have access to see and edit everything.
- Offline Data Sync: Enable offline data entry and automatic synchronisation when connectivity is restored, with clear sync status indicators.
- QR Code Management: Generate unique QR codes for truck journeys and soil samples. Implement a QR code scanning interface with a manual fallback system using 6-character codes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark green (#1B5E20) to represent the earth and agriculture.
- Secondary color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to provide a neutral background.
- Accent: Terracotta (#E07A5F) for call-to-action buttons and important notifications.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts for form labels and data display for readability in various lighting conditions.
- Use clear and simple icons to represent different actions and data types within the application.
- Prioritize a mobile-first, responsive layout to ensure usability on various devices and screen sizes.
